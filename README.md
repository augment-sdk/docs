# ðŸ§  AugmentSDK: Dynamic Memory Orchestration for AI
Documentation &amp; Guides

AugmentSDK introduces Recursive AI Memory Structuring, a paradigm shift from static knowledge retrieval to self-learning AI augmentation. The SDK provides developers with modular tools to integrate advanced memory optimization into any AI/ML model, enabling systems that remember, reflect, and refine their understanding over time.


# AugmentSDK is a comprehensive toolkit designed to solve one of AI's most critical limitations: the lack of persistent, evolving memory. Current AI models, regardless of their sophistication, operate with fragmented, transient recallâ€”each session begins anew, disconnected from previous interactions and insights.

Vision

"What if AI didn't just respond, but reflected?
What if AI didn't just process, but progressed?
What if AI wasn't just smart, but wise?"
â€” Roland H. Streeter Jr., Founder

# Developed by Augment Human Agency, this toolkit aims to revolutionize how AI systems manage knowledge, creating intelligence that thinks in timelines, not transactions.

# Core Concepts
Hierarchical Memory Structure
# AugmentSDK organizes AI memory like the human brain, with distinct yet interconnected layers:

Ephemeral Memory (Short-Term Recall)  
Session-based interactions and immediate recall  
Working Memory (Task-Oriented Retention)  
Insights for ongoing projects, cleared upon completion  
Semantic Memory (Core Knowledge Base)  
Long-term, structured knowledge with concept mapping  
Procedural Memory (How-To & Process Learning)  
Methods, techniques, and workflows for transferable skills  
Reflective Memory (Self-Optimization & Meta-Cognition)  
Review of past responses, adjustment of reasoning  
Predictive Memory (Anticipating Future Knowledge Needs)  
Latent knowledge pathways based on historical patterns  

Key Innovations

Self-Reflection & Refinement of stored knowledge  
Context-Linked Recall beyond simple keyword matching  
Recursive Learning through continuous re-evaluation  
Dynamic Prioritization of memories based on relevance  
Memory Decay & Rejuvenation for adaptive knowledge management
